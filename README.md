# Deep Reinforcement Learning Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of reinforcement learning tutorials written in python and Tensorflow. They are based on Arthur Juliani's series published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@awjuliani/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0#.4gyadb8a4), with additional comments and content intended to provide clearer explanation.
The tutorials also include some content from David Silver's reinforcement learning lectures [at UCL](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html).
